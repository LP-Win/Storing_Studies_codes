      A steam engine is a heat engine that performs mechanical work using steam
      as its working fluid. The steam engine uses the force produced by steam
      pressure to push a piston back and forth inside a cylinder. This pushing
      force can be transformed by a connecting rod and crank into rotational
      force for work. The term "steam engine" is most commonly applied to
      reciprocating engines as just described, although some authorities have
      also referred to the steam turbine and devices such as Hero's aeolipile as
      <strong>"steam engines"</strong>. The essential feature of steam engines is that they are
      external combustion engines,[1] where the working fluid is separated from
      the combustion products. The ideal <b>thermodynamic</b> cycle used to analyze
      this process is called the Rankine cycle. In general usage, the term steam
      engine can refer to either complete steam plants (including boilers etc.),
      such as railway steam locomotives and portable engines, or may refer to
      the piston or turbine machinery alone, as in the beam engine and
      stationary steam engine.
